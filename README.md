# Jetpack Compose: Advanced State and Side Effects

Our learning is going to get very interesting as we will be learning about using transition effects. Long are the days when I had to use [Robert Penner's](http://robertpenner.com/easing/) 
easing functions for Adobe Flash. But transitions remain no matter the times and technologies.

What we will be learning

- How to use coroutines with Jetpack compose
- How to add different types of transitions or called also effects
- Learn of good operators in Compose for coroutines such as `rememberCoroutineScope`
