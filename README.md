# Jetpack Compose - State hoisting

In Composable functions, state that is read or modified by multiple functions should live in a common ancestorâ€”this process is called state hoisting. To hoist means to lift or elevate.

Only specific ui elements are redrawn. For example swapping screens take effect. When viewing second screen with a list view, those items are drawn. Every time one cell is expanded or collapsed then that given cell is redrawn while the other cell has no drawing updates.
