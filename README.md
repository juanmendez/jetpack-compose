There was a time in 2021 I worked solely in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Their reactive pattern is very similar to what's being used in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Where in Flutter there are stateless and stateful widgets, here composables dictate themselves to be stateful or not. But overall it is the same flowable pattern propagating changes in ui elements where there is necessity and skipping others which don't need it.

One thing is for sure this reactive pattern is used also in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and other frameworks such as [Swift UI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).
