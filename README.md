# Jetpack Compose

In this chapter we learn how modifiers are of best practice to be available as arguments in our composables.
In this way the caller can tailor the modifier, and as seeen previously we can always augment features as `Modifier` applies the builder pattern.

> You should always think about providing parameters to customize the composable you're writing. 
> You should also add a modifier property so the composable's look and feel can be adapted from the outside.
