In the definition of colors

```

    The primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your app's screens and components.
    The secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your app.
    The surface color affects surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus.
    The background color appears behind scrollable content.
    The on color elements appear on top of other colors in the palette, and are primarily applied to text, iconography, and strokes. In our color palette, we have an onSurface color, which appears on top of the surface color, and an onPrimary color, which appears on top of the primary color.
```

It is very interesting how the prefix `on` is used to be on top and contrast with any other color suchas `onPrimary` contrasts with `primary` color.
